**My Idea:**
I hope to build a comprehensive task management app designed to help users track their time and gain analytical insights into their productivity. 
It will feature integrated timers to monitor the time spent on each task and provide options to review progress through intuitive visualizations. 
It is designed to promote better habits by offering detailed analytics on task completion patterns, 
helping users refine their time management and work toward their goals. 
While ambitious, the app's MVP will serve as a practical foundation for experimenting with machine learning components to deliver actionable insights for users.







## Notes

I encountered some challenges navigating certain buttons within Xcode, but it was worthwhile!
